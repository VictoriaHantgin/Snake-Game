## DESCRIPTION

My Snake Game is a spin on the classic snake game that we all know and love. The Game starts with a Main menu, where the player can choose to click the "Play" or "Quit" buttons. Clicking the "play" button will take the character to the main game. The player will then control a snake who moves around the board using the input from the player's keyboard arrows. If a player interacts with an apple, the snake will grow one unit larger, and the score will increase by 1. If a snake interacts with a medkit, its life counter will increase by 1. If the snake runs into the side of the screen window, the player will lose a life. If the snake runs into itself, it will also lose a life. If the player's life goes down to 0, then the game will end and the player will be taken back to the main menu. 

I have included multiple files that make up the sprite of the snake, apple, and life power(medkit). These will be found in the "sprites" folder. There is also a folder labeled "sound" which contains the sound effects and music for the game. Finally, there is a folder labeled "fonts" that contain the fonts for the game. 

Originally, I had hoped to implement a speed boost power, but could not seem to find a way to successfully implement it. Instead, I decided to add a menu system to the game, so that the player is not immediately thrust into gameplay.
